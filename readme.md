## signup

The init button generates a integral `key` and a `publicKey` such that `publicKey = g <sup>key</sup>` for some group generated by g.
`publicKey` is stored in a file `verify.txt`.

## login
The form accepts an integer `key` and proves `publicKey == generator <sup>key</sup>` for some `publicKey` found in `verify.txt`.

The proof is sent to the server for authentication.

## issues
1. This is not a security tool.

1. please excuse the poorly written code including the lack of comments.
